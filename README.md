# FibonacciNim-Game
This game is a variation of a class of mathematical games that are related to one called Nim. It's called Fibonacci Nim because the Fibonacci numbers play a role in its mathematical analysis.

## About the Game
The game is for two players
Players take it in turns to play
The players have 3 heaps of coins.
Each heap will start with 13 coins.
They take it in turns to take some number of coins from ONE heap.
On the first turn, they cannot take all the coins from a heap (that is, they can choose to take at most 12).
On all later turns they can take at most twice as many coins as were taken from that particular heap on the turn before (they can take less than that if they want).
They must take at least 1 coin - they can’t ‘skip’ a turn (see below).
They obviously cannot take more coins than are present in a heap.
The player who takes the last coin wins.
